# com.firebase.sdk

Firbase provies powerful API to store and sync data in realtime. When data changes, apps built with Firebase update instantly across every device.

`Firebase` object available in window scope and it is available after the device `deviceready` event.

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
    function onDeviceReady() {
        console.log(device.cordova);
    }

## Installation

You can install the Firebase Cordova plugin using the following command:

    cordova plugin add #PATH_TO_FIREBASE_REPO#

## Getting started

1. Create Firebase instance.

    //Use YOUR Firebase URL (not the one below)
    var fb = new Firebase("https://<your-firebase>.firebaseio.com");


2. Save Data

Firebase stores data as standard JSON. You can either set a single object in the following way:

    fb.set({ name : "Telerik", message: "Hello World" });

Or you can multiple messages via push operation:

    fb.push({ name : "Telerik", message: "Hello World" });

3. Listen to Event changes

Firebase responds immediately to data changes as they occur.

    fb.on("value", function(data) {
      var name = data.val() ? data.val().name : "";
      alert("My name is " + name);
    });

In case of push messages, it will look like:

    app.fb.on("child_added", function(snapshot){
       var data = snapshot.val();
       alert(data.name + "said: " + data.message);
    });
